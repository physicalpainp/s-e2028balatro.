# READ CAREFULLY:
• MAKE SURE YOU'RE ON THE LATEST VERSION OF STEAMODDED & LOVELY. So many people send a crash report that is entirely fixable with just updating your mod dependencies...
• Don't send a report if you're running other mods (outside of steamodded & talisman). I cannot guarantee cross-compatibility with every other balatro mod out there.
• Windows only, i can't bugtest stuff on Mac or (god forbid) Android.

## Describe the bug
